# entity-store - Adapter to persist entity objects to various storage type. Redis, MongoDB etc

entity-store comes with a fully featured in memory engine which is super handy for testing your models.
For real world use you'll need to get one of the database powered engines:
* [Redis](https://github.com/serby/entity-store-redis)
* [MongoDB](https://github.com/serby/entity-store-mongodb)
* [Postgres](https://github.com/serby/entity-store-postgres)

If you database of choice isn't listed here please create an engine and send me a pull request.
